# bounded_lognorm
Bounded lognormal continuous probability distribution.

The bounded lognormal is a continuous probability distribution derived from the lognormal distribution. Unlike the normal and lognormal distributions, its domain has both upper and lower bounds, and it may be either symmetrical or non-symmetrical, depending on its parameters. It therefore may be a good fit for many natural phenomena, for which there are known limits, for example adult male height.

The bounded lognormal distribution is implemented in Python as an instance of the scipy.stats.rv_continuous class and inherits from it a collection of generic methods.
